## Apps by Cocoatype

[**Kineo**](https://kineo.app/) is a tool to make hand-drawn flipbook-style animations.

[**Black Highlighter**](https://blackhighlighter.app/) makes it easy to hide secret information you don't want to share in images you're going to share anyway.

[**Scrawl**](https://scrawlapp.com) is a place to put temporary notes. Once your notes are in Scrawl, they're easy to access everywhere: your lock screen, your home screen, your Mac, and more.

[**Debigulator**](https://debigulator.app/) shrinks images so that you can share them faster across bad internet connections.
