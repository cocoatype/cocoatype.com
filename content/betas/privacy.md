title: "Beta Privacy Policy"
---

This privacy policy applies to all beta testing performed by Cocoatype, LLC. The apps it applies to include, but are not limited to:

- Black Highlighter
- Chuck&apos;s Hop Shop
- Debigulator
- Kineo
- Scrawl Notes
- Snapper
- Wing Luke Museum

## Logging

If you visit the Cocoatype website (this website!) using a web browser, either a standalone browser or the one included inside a beta app, some metadata about that visit is logged temporarily. This may include: your IP address, some information about the browser making the request (such as OS, browser version, etc.), and the time and date of the request.

I basically never look at these logs, but they’re useful for diagnosing issues, and can be used to watch for trends such as where new users are being referred from. These logs are deleted automatically after two weeks.

## Crash Reports

If you experience a crash or some other major error while using a beta app, an error report with some limited diagnostic information is sent to the app developers. This data includes your device model, current OS version, and current version of the app. It does **not** include any personal data, anything you were working on, anything that can be used to identify a single user, etc. This data stays entirely on our servers, and is never shared with any third parties.

## Customer Support

If you [e-mail me](mailto:hello@cocoatype.com), I have the contents of that e-mail and the address that it came from. I generally keep these e-mails forever because it helps identify problems that multiple customers have had, and so I can send updates if your issue is addressed. If you’d rather I not keep your e-mails, just let me know, and they’ll be deleted when our conversation is finished.

## Third Party Services

### Apple
Apple may (depending on your preferences) collect some analytics about your use of beta apps and send them (anonymized, in bulk) to me for identifying crashes, general usage trends, etc. [Apple’s privacy policy](https://apple.com/privacy) details how Apple handles your data.

## Other Information

This privacy policy might change over time. A full change history is available upon request.

If you have any questions about anything on this page, or have some other concern, [send me an e-mail](mailto:hello@cocoatype.com).
